## Running the bot

Running the bot shouldn't be hard for an experienced user but might give a headache for a first timer.

1. Install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) if don't have them already
1. Create an application at [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
1. Create a bot for the application
1. Copy the bot's token and enable all intents (Too lazy to worry about problems with intents)
1. Copy the `src/config.example.js` to `src/config.js`
1. Edit the config to your needs
1. Install dependencies with `yarn`
1. Run with `yarn start`
